# RSA_text_encryption_program
RSA text encryption/decryption program

Program designed to encrypt text documents using the RSA encryption algorithm.

Input: a .txt file with the name "RSA_text.txt"
Output: Depending on the options selected one or both of the files : RSA_text_crypted.txt , RSA_text_decrypted.txt

How to use: To encrypt a document you need a public key, if you already have one you may use that key.
Otherwise you can generate a new public key, following the instructions in the program.
To decrypt a document you need a private key, the pair of the public key with which the document was encrypted.
